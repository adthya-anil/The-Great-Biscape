# 🥖 The Great Biscape  
**Tagline:** *Kittiya Kitti Poya Poi? Ini Illa!*  
*"Because every biscuit deserves a fighting chance."*

## 🚀 About the Project  
Have you ever dunked a biscuit into tea, stared into its soggy soul, and prayed it doesn’t betray you?  
We did.  
And then we built **The Great Biscape** — a *completely unnecessary* but *absurdly precise* AI-powered biscuit dunk-timer.  

Armed with Python, OpenCV, Numpy, and an unhealthy obsession with not losing biscuits, we made a system that:  
1. Detects your glass using **green marker strips** we manually added (7 lines, spaced 1 cm apart, for *military-grade dunk precision*).  
2. Locks onto it like a biscuit-seeking missile.  
3. Tracks the biscuit in real time.  
4. Senses the exact moment it touches tea/milk.  
5. Measures *depth of dunk* using our magical green strips.  
6. Starts two timers:  
   - **Safe Dunk Timer** – pull out now, biscuit survives.  
   - **Danger Dunk Timer** – pull out now… and it’s already too late.  

Is it over-engineered? Absolutely.  
Is it the pinnacle of modern dunk technology? Also yes.

## 🛠️ What We Learned  
This was our first rodeo with:
- 🐍 **Python** – more indentation, fewer tears (mostly).  
- 👁 **OpenCV** – turns out computers *can* see biscuits.  
- 🔢 **Numpy** – maths, but make it fast.  
- 📊 **Pandas** – because why not store biscuit death statistics too?  

We learned how to:
- Detect objects using color ranges.
- Lock a Region of Interest (ROI) manually.
- Fine-tune real-time tracking for moving snacks.
- Mix humor with serious tech. (The judges were *concerned*, but impressed.)

## 🎯 The "Useless" Theme  
The hackathon theme was **Useless Projects**.  
Our team name is **CusCus**.  
Our members:  
1. Adithya Anil  - Biscuit Engineer
2. AthulKrishnan S.  - Dunk Time Scientist

We decided to prove that uselessness is an art form… and also an exact science.

## 🧠 How It Works (Biscuit Science™)
- Place the glass with **7 green strips** stuck vertically.
- The camera detects these strips and locks the frame.
- Drop the biscuit into the tea/milk — *science engages*.  
- The moment the biscuit touches liquid, **Safe Timer** begins.  
- If you miss that… the **Danger Timer** starts counting to disaster.  
- You can manually set:
  - ROI region.
  - Biscuit color range detection.
- Output: You get told exactly when to save your snack… or when to say goodbye.

## 🏗 Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** – because we needed a cool UI for our nonsense.
- **OpenCV**
- **Numpy**
- **Pandas**

## 💡 Future Scope (Because Why Stop Here?)
- Dunk prediction AI trained on biscuit brands (*Marie vs Oreo survival rates*).  
- Biscuit leaderboard (*for dunking bragging rights*).  
- Integration with a buzzer to scream at you.
